# 🐻 Hug Bunny
I've recreated the **Hug Bunny** game as a modern **React application**! This version keeps the cozy charm of the original but brings several improvements for a better, more responsive experience.

## 🚀 What's New

- 🔧 **React Integration** – Fully component-based, maintainable structure
- 🎮 **Improved Start Screen** – Friendly intro with gameplay instructions
- ❤️ **Enhanced UI** – Heart counter uses stylish [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) icons
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Click the **Start Game** button to begin  
2. Click or tap anywhere on the screen to move the bear  
3. Walk up to sad bunnies to hug them  
4. Use the radar (center screen) to locate nearby bunnies  
5. Hug all **45** sad bunnies in the forest to win!
